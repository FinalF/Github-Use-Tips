Here's the basic pattern:
commit your changes locally:
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "made some changes"
then push them to github. In the code below, the first line is only needed the first time you push to github.
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/yourreponame.git
$ git push origin master
